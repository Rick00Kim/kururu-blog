## SUMMARY

Hello, My name is Kuhyun Kim.

I worked for system engineer in Japan.

I had been worked 3 years in develop team.

I was implement web application; API, view and Batch application. Both using Java and Spring framework.

And I was worked in Operation team.

I mainly did support for Develop teams, server monitoring, writing script for automation and Release to production system.

Because of my current work environment, I am comfortable working on Linux or Unix systems more than Windows system.

I'm interested in new IT technology and I am very experimental.

So I am current working for devops in Korea.

I mainly use about AWS cloud system.
